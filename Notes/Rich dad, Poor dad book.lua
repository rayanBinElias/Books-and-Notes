Escrow and title company 
	- handles the legal transaction of servicing of the payments

Escrow 
	- is a legal arrangement in which a third party temporarily holds money 
	- or property until a particular condition has been met 
		- such as the fulfillment of a purchase agreement.

"10% yearly divident from investment"

A mortgage 
	- is a type of loan used to purchase or maintain a home, plot of land, or other type of real estate. 
	- The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time.
		- principal and interest.
	- propert serves as collateral to secure the loan.

"Time is one of your greatest assets."

I use two main vehicles to achieve financial growth: 
	1. real estate

	2. small-cap stocks. 
		- fast growth

	"Don't do investment that you don't understand cuz it's too complex"

	"Simple math and common sense is all you need"


example
	1. house during market depression
		- house price at 65,000
		- buy at 45,000

		- DP at 5,000 and 40,000 for mortgage
		- move out in one week
		- Additional cost
			- mortgage
			- expenses
			- mngmt fees

	- retain some percent if it's a good company
	- stocks
		- 25 cents per share
			- 2 dollars per share or 20  or more per share

"It is financial intelligence that improves the odds."

"It is not gambling if you know what you’re doing."

"What I do is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things."

It is gambling if you’re just throwing money into a deal and praying"

"Sometimes you win and sometimes you learn."

"If you don't try you will never win"
	- mistakes are learning opportunity

"Failure is part of the process of success"
	- if you avoid it, you also avoid success

"I look at money much like my game of tennis. I play hard, make mistakes, correct, make more mistakes, correct, and
get better. If I lose the game, I reach across the net, shake
my opponents hand, smile, and say:"
	- “See you next Saturday.”

"Only play that I can afford to lose"

								- 90 days to raise the rest of money
								- or 50k profit to walk away and the one who give me 100k will take over

				"It’s what you know more than what you buy. 
				Investing is not buying. It’s more a case of knowing."

			3. Organize smart people.

Lesson 7: Overcoming Obstacles
	"The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear"

	5 traits that hinders success:
		1. fear
		2. Cynicism
		3. Laziness
		4. Bad habits
		5. arrogance

	Overcoming Fear
		"It’s how you handle failure that makes the difference in one’s life."

		"“If you hate risk and worry, start early.”"

		"For most people, the reason they don’t win financially is because the pain of losing moneyis far greater than the joy of being rich."

		"‘Remember the Alamo!’"

		"failure would only make him stronger and smarter"

		"“They took a great failure and turned it into inspiration… as well a tourist destination that makes them millions.”"

		" For winners, losing inspires them. For losers, losing defeats them.."

		"“I always tried to turn every disaster into an opportunity.”"

		"Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets and FOCUS: Follow One Course Until Successful."

		"It takes guts, patience, and a great attitude toward failure."

		" Losers avoid failing. And failure turns losers into winners. Just remember the Alamo."

	Overcoming Cynicism
		Sample transaction	
			Actual price is 65,000
				- got it at 42,000
					- DP of 5000

			Monthly payment of 1000-2500 per rent at price of 95,000

		"The little chicken won, and a chance at freedom was lost."
				
		"I hold a small portion of my assets in tax-lien certificates instead of CDs."
			- secured by real estate and enforced by state law, 

		"The real world is simply waiting for you to get rich. Only a person’s doubts keep them poor."

		"“Cynics criticize, and winners analyze”"

		"see opportunities that everyone else missed"

		"finding what people miss is key to any success."

		"finding a great property manager who runs houses or apartments, well, my cash flow goes up"

		"A great property manager often hears of great deals before real estate agents do, which makes them even more valuable."

		"So when you’re in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what Colonel Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it."

	Overcoming Laziness
		"That’s the most common form of laziness: 
			- laziness by staying busy."
		
		"Rich dad believed that the words “I can’t afford it” shut down your brain. 
			“How can I afford it?” 
				- opens up possibilities, excitement, and dreams."

		"Come on. Lets go to the gym and work out."

		"Im sick and tired of being poor. Lets get out there and get rich."

		"What’s In It For Me?”"

		"“What would my life be like if I never had to work again?”
		“What would I do if I had all the money I needed?” "

		"Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you’ll be criticized anyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don’t."

		"Guilt is worse than greed, for guilt robs the body of its soul.”"

	Overcoming Bad habits
		"I just pay myself first. Before I pay even the government."

		"I still pay myself first. Even if I’m short of money. My asset column is far more important to me than the government."

		"The pressure to pay my taxes and the other creditors is so great that it forces me to seek other forms of income"

		"I decided to use the fear of the bully to make me stronger."

		"The more I work my mental money muscles out, the stronger I get. Now I’m not afraid of those bullies.”"

	Overcoming Arrogance
		"What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me money"

		"Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because when I’m arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not important"

		"Start educating yourself by finding an expert in the field or a book on the subject."

Lesson 8: Getting Started
	"There is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it."

	10 steps as a process to develop finanacial genius:
		1. Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit
			- "I do it for myself and the people I love. It’s love that gets me over the hurdles and sacrifices.”"

			I don't want
				- not have an asset before 35
				- regrets
				- no choices
				- poor
				- no freedom

			"Without a strong reason or purpose, anything in life is hard."
		
		2. Make daily choices: the power of choice
			"I just choose to be rich, and I make that choice every day."

			"the only real asset you have is your mind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over."

			"“How would Donald Trump do this, or Warren Buffett or George Soros?"
			
			"Listening is more important than talking. "

			"Learn to ask so I can listen in order to absorb new ideas and possibilities"

		3. Choose friends carefully: the power of association
			"my friends with money talk about money"
			
			"Don’t listen to poor or frightened people"

			"Goal is 16 percent ROI divident per year"
				- from gov't

			"Wealthbuilding is to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd."

			"The crowd that shows up late that is slaughtered."

			"If a great deal is on the front page, 
				it’s too late in most instances. Look for a new deal"

			"“There is always another wave.”"

			"People who hurry and catch a wave late usually are the ones who wipe out."

			"If they miss a wave, they search for the next one and get themselves in position. "

			"Wise investors have already taken their profits and moved on"
				- when deal is on front page

			"Wise investors buy an investment when it’s not popular."

			"They get in position forthe next big swell."

			"It’s all “insider trading.”"

				- be a legal insider trader

			"Have rich friends is because that is where the money is made"
				- next boom, get in, and get out before the next bust

			"The sooner you know, the better your chances are for profits with minimal risk."

Page 180
		
		4. Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of learning quickly
			"“You become what you study.” "

			"Master the art of buying foreclosures."
		
			"It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless."
		
			"It’s priceless in finding faster formulas—recipes, if you will—for making dough"
		
			"money is an old formula born in the day of cavemen."

		5. Pay yourself first: the power of self-discipline
			"The world pushes people around, not because other people are bullies, but because the individual lacks internal control and discipline."
		
			Three most important management skills necessary to start your own business are management of:
				1. Cash flow
				2. People
				3. Personal Time

			"Financial literacy allows one to read numbers, and numbers tell the story. By looking at a person’s income statement and balance sheet,"

			"A picture is worth a thousand words."

			"Each month, they allocate money to their asset column before they pay their monthly expenses."
		
			"I minimize my income is because I don’t want to pay it to the government."

			"That is why my income comes from my asset column, through a Nevada corporation."
		
			"My tenants pay for my liabilities"

			"They inspire me to go out and create more money"

			To successfully pay yourself first, keep the following in mind:
				1. Don’t get into large debt positions that you have to pay
				for. Keep your expenses low. Build up assets first. Then
				buy the big house or nice car. Being stuck in the Rat
				Race is not intelligent.
				
				2. When you come up short, let the pressure build and
				don’t dip into your savings or investments. Use the
				pressure to inspire your financial genius to come up with
				new ways of making more money, and then pay your
				bills. You will have increased your ability to make more
				money as well as your financial intelligence.
		
			"So many times I have gotten into financial hot water and used my brain to create more income while staunchly defending the assets in my asset column."

			"The rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills"
		
			"Life was meant to be enjoyed."

			Financial genius, 
				- you can have all the goodies of life, 
				- get rich, 
				- and pay bills. 
		
		6. Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice
			"The people are professionals, their services should make you money"
		
			"The more money they make, the more money I make."
		
			"A good broker should provide you with information, as well as take the time to educate you."
		
			"A good broker saves me time, in addition to making memoney—"

			"A broker is my eyes and ears in the market."

			"Why would I want to save a few bucks when I could use that time to make more money or spend it with those I love?"
		
			"I first find out how much property or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in taxes. "

			"Find a broker who has your best interests at heart."

			"The real skill is to manage and reward the people who are smarter than you in some technical area."
		
		7. Be an Indian giver: the power of getting something for nothing
	Page 190

			"The sophisticated investor’s first question is:
				- “How fast do I get my money back?"
		
			Money back in three years is okay
				- ROI after 3 years

			" I only play with money I can afford to lose."
		
			"10 investments, I hit home runs on two or three"

			"So wise investors must look at more than ROI. They look at the assets they get for free once they get their moneyback."

		8. Use assets to buy luxuries: the power of focus
			"With weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of least resistance"

			"We go to school to learn a profession so we can work for money. "
				- used that money to create an asset
					- if asset makes more than my profession
						- FIRE
		
			"I use my desire to consume to inspire and motivate my financial genius to invest."

			"focus on creating money."

			"If your financial intelligence is low, money will run all over you. "

			"If money is smarter than you, you will work for it all your life."

		9.	Choose heroes: the power of myth
			" when I’m in the market or I’m negotiating a deal, I am subconsciously acting with the bravado of Trump"

			"“If they can do it, so can I.”"

			"find heroes who make it look easy."

		10. Teach and you shall receive: the power of giving
			". “If you want something, you firstneed to give,” "
				
			" I trust that the principle of reciprocity is true, and I give what I want. "	

			"In my life, whenever I have felt needy or short of money or short of help, I simply went out or foundin my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it first."

			"your world is only a mirror of you"


Lesson 9: Still want more? Here are some to do's
	1. Stop doing what you’re doing. 
		- In other words, take a break and assess what is working and what is not working.

	2. Look for new ideas. 
		- For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores and search for books on different and unique subjects.

		The 16 Percent Solution by Joel Moskowitz.
	
	3. Find someone who has done what you want to do.
		- Take them to lunch and ask them for tips and tricks of the trade. 
		- 16 percent tax-lien certificates, I went to the county tax office and found the government employee who worked in that office.

		- It took a day to read the book, 
		- a day to take action, 
		- an hour for lunch, 
		- and a day to acquiretwo great deals.

	4. Take classes, read, and attend seminars. 
		- I search newspapers and the Internet for new and interesting classes, many of which are free or inexpensive.

	5. Make lots of offers. 
		- When I want a piece of real estate, 
		- I look at many properties and generally write an offer. 
		- offering half of what the owners asked for. 

		"I always make offers with escape clauses"
			- “subject-to”
			- contingencies, 
			- such as the approval of a business partner.

	6. Finding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the right investors, or whatever is just like dating
		- You must go to the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers, counteroffers, negotiate, reject, and accept.

	7. Jog, walk, or drive a certain area once a month for 10 minutes. 
		- I have found some of my best real estate investments doing this.

		"I talk to the postal carriers.It’s amazing how much information they acquire about an area. "

	8. Shop for bargains in all markets. 
		- Consumers will always be poor.

		"Profits are made in the buying, not in the selling."

	9. Look in the right places. 
		- A neighbor bought a condominium for $100,000. 
		- I bought the identical condo next door for $50,000. 

		- I shopped at the foreclosure auction. 
			- I paid $500 for a class on how to do this.

	10. Look for people who want to buy first. 
		- Then look for someone who wants to sell. 
		- A friend was looking for a certain piece of land.
		- I found a large piece of land, larger than what my friend wanted to buy, tied it up with an option, called my friend, and he said he wanted a piece of it. 

		- Buy the pie, and cut it in pieces.
			- pool some buyer to buy big propertry.
			
	11. Think big	
		- Retailers love giving volume discounts, simply because most business people love big spenders. 
		- We then went to different dealers and negotiated a great deal because we wanted to buy so many. 

	12. Learn from History	
		- All the big companies on the stock exchange started out as small companies.
		- sanders lost everyhting in his 60s

	13. Action always beats inaction
		- The important words are 
			- “have done” and 
			- “do.”
